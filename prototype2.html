                <p class="response">Should games in a trophy rivalry series be listed under that trophy if the games in question were played 20-25 years before the trophy existed? The Black Diamond Trophy didn't exist until 1997, but games played in the 70s are listed as part of that trophy series. <button type="button" class="btn btn-info btn-xs reply">Reply</button></p>

                    <p class="response"> See, this is why all rivalries need to be listed as SCHOOL-OTHER SCHOOL rivalry. I'd recommend moving the article to that, and then adding in the full results. <button type="button" class="btn btn-info btn-xs reply">Reply</button></p>

                                <p class="response">Personally, I like what's been done with Arizonaâ€“New Mexico football rivalry; where the "Series" tab has been subdivided out into separate "Overall" and "Trophy" sections. As far as the naming of rivalry articles, just like the names of any other articles on Wikipedia, WP:COMMONNAME is the guideline that should be followed when naming them. <button type="button" class="btn btn-info btn-xs reply">Reply</button></p>

                <p class="response">There is a Wikipedia article titled Most weeks ranked number 1 (NCAA football). It is, in my opinion, an article that should either be merged into the AP Poll article or simply deleted. The current text of the article is: This is a list of college football teams by the number of weeks they have been ranked number 1 in the AP Polls. Updated 09-22-2013. This is followed by a 3-column list (Number, School, Weeks) of the 11 teams that have been ranked at #1 most often in the AP Poll. That, plus a list of references (most of which are other Wikipedia pages), constitute the entire article. <button type="button" class="btn btn-info btn-xs reply">Reply</button></p>

                    <p class="response">This article is an orphan, and while it is being updated, it hasn't had any substantial text added to the body of the article since it was created, other than the list itself. Can some other folks visit the page and let me know if there's anything I'm missing? Because as I see it, this information doesn't need a separate article to exist. <button type="button" class="btn btn-info btn-xs reply">Reply</button></p>

                    <p class="response">I added some "citation needed" and unsupported attribution clean-up tags to the lead of the list Most weeks ranked number 1 (NCAA football). They were then inappropriately reverted by an anonymous IP citing vandalism. Please keep your eye on or discuss on the article's talk page, where I also started a discussion about the Coaches' poll or renaming the article to fix its sole reliance on the AP poll. The football team navbox format has begun to spread to other sports, college basketball, although no discussions where had pertaining to those sports before mass edits were implemented. This time, I hope to get a real consensus on a format, with a lot of input, not just the usual handful of editors that normally participate...<button type="button" class="btn btn-warning btn-xs" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo">Read more</button> <button type="button" class="btn btn-info btn-xs reply">Reply</button></p>
